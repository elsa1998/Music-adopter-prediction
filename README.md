## Modeling
- Build 3 models (KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree) and compare the goodness(ROC, precision, recall, accuracy, F-measure, AUC curve).
- Get the decision tree as the best classifier to predict customers who are likely to convert from free to premium subscribers in the next 6 month period, if they are targeted by our promotional campaign.
